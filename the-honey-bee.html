                    Honey bee colonies are primarily female: apart from the queen, nearly all the other bees are female
                    worker bees. Male honey bees live only during the spring and summer months, dying off by autumn.
                    Each
                    type of bee has a
                    specific set of roles, they look significantly different to the other
                    and have differing life-spans.

                            alt="A queen bee walking across some honeycomb, worker bees around her" padding="10"

                    <br>
                    <p>The queen is the dominant female in the hive: a happy queen means a happy hive, an aggressive queen
                    means an angry hive. She is the only bee capable of laying eggs to produce both worker
                    and drone brood and, without a queen, a colony will die.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Queens can live up to five
                    years, although a lifespan of 2 - 3 years is more common; some queens
                    become 'drone laying' queens in their later life, which means they are
                    no longer able to lay eggs for worker bees. When the colony senses
                    this, they will either kill her or drive her out of the hive and
                    replace her with a new queen bred from a worker bee egg.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        While it is true to say that the queen is the dominant female, the exact relationship between
                        the queen and the
                        worker bees is complex. As far as we can tell, the queen is indeed in charge, but only as long
                        as the worker bees
                        allow her to be.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is only one queen bee per hive (with some rare exceptions)</li>
                        <li>The queen take sixteen days to grow from an egg to an adult bee, which is much quicker than
                            workers and drones</li>
                        <li>Several days after hatching from her cell, the queen bee will embark upon he must
                            first 'honeymoon flight' when she will mate with between 10 and 20 drones; she may repeat
                            this procedure several times before she becomes fully fertilized.</li>
                        <li>The queen sets the tone for the hive: if the queen is placid, so is the hive, and likewise
                            if you have a grumpy queen, the workers will be too. </li>
                        <li>Queens normally live for around three years before either dying or being kicked out by the
                            worker bees if she
                            becomes infertile (a so-called 'drone-laying' queen.</li>
                        <li>Queen bees can sting, although they do so rarely. Unlike worker bees, however, they can
                            still
                            multiple times without dying.</li>
                        <li>The brightly coloured spot on the back of many queens is added by the beekeeper to help find
                            her
                            among the thousands
                            of other bees in the hive. The colour of the spot matches the year in which she was born.

                    <br>
                    <p>All worker bees are female and they make up the bulk of a colony: apart from the Queen, they are
                        the only bees in the hive during autumn and winter, while during the spring and summer,
                        they make up 98 - 99% of all bees in the hive.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>What do worker bees do? The workers go through several different roles depending on their age.
                        The youngest start off as nurse bees, feeding the larvae and ensuring the brood (the eggs and egg
                        cells) remain warm; as they get older, they process the nectar
                        and pollen, produce wax, build honeycomb, feed the queen, and ensure that she is neither too
                        warm nor cold. The oldest workers leave the hive to collect nectar and pollen from plants and
                        flowers.
                    </p>

                        <li>Worker bees are the most common types of honey bee and they are as essential to the
                            successful running of the give as the queen</li>
                        <li>Worker bees take 21 days to grow from from egg to adult</li>
                        <li>Worker bees born in spring and summer live for up to 8 weeks; those born in winter can live
                            for 4 - 5 months.</li>
                        <li>Worker bees are the stingers! If you have been stung by a honey bee, it is 99.99% sure it
                            was a worker. And it is
                            deadly for the bee: their stingers are barbed. This means that the stinger remains stuck in
                            her victim when a bee
                            pulls herself away, leading to her disembowlment. She will die a short time later.</li>
                        <li>Workers will fly up to 8km / 5 miles to gather nectar and pollen.

                        <p>Drones are the male honey bees. The are much larger and bulkier than their worker sisters,
                            and live only during
                            the sping and summer months for around 90 days, at most. Their only 'practical' purpose is
                            mating, given that they do
                            not collect pollen or
                            nectar, build no honeycomb and none of the other tasks that a worker bee has. However,
                            drones are crucial in
                            that they fertilize the queen bee during her honeymoon flight / flights. An unfertilized
                            queen can only lay
                            drone brood, and as drones have no instinct to gather resources or take care of the brood, a
                            colony full of
                            drones would soon die. So despite their limited role, they are crucial for the survival
                            of the honey bee.
                        <ul id="drone-notes">
                            <li>Drones take 24 days to grow from egg to adult bee.</li>
                            <li>They normally live for 30 - 50 days, though are capable of living for up to 3 months.

                            <li>As far as scientists can tell, their main purpose is to mate with a queen bee. Those who
                                do successfully mate with a queen die shortly after, as the act of mating is deadly to
                                the drone.</li>
                            <li>Any drones which survive until autumn will be kicked out of the hive by the worker bees
                                to preserve resources for the colony; such drones will then die.</li>
