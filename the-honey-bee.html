            <p>
                Honey bee colonies are mostly female, made up of the queen bee, and
                the worker bees; the only male honey bees are born during the spring
                and summer months, and die off by autumn. Each type of bee has a
                specific set of roles, they look significantly different to the other
                and have differing life-spans.

                <div><h3>The queen bee</h3>
                <p>
                    The queen is the dominant female in the hive; she lays eggs throughout
                    the year to ensure the colony has enough bees to survive the fairly
                    short lifespan of the workers and drone. Queens can live up to five
                    years, although a lifespan of 2 - 3 years is more common; some queens
                    become 'drone laying' queens in their later life, which means they are
                    no longer able to lay eggs for worker bees. When the colony senses
                    this, they will either kill her or drive her out of the hive and
                    replace her with a new queen bred from a worker bee egg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it is true to say that the queen is the dominant female in that
                    there is only one, and she is the only egg-layer, it would be
                    incorrect to say that she is in charge. Scientists have yet to
                    definitively define the exact relationship between the queen and the
                    worker bees, but we do know that it is a complex relationship whereby
                    the queen is indeed in charge, but only as long as the worker bees
                    allow her to be. Her importance to the give is however vital, and without a queen, a colony will
                    soon fall apart.

            <div>
                <ul id="queen-notes">
                    <li>There is only one queen bee per hive (with some rare exceptions)</li>
                    <li>The queen take sixteen days to grow from an egg to an adult bee, which is much quicker than
                        workers and drones</li>
                        <li>When she emerges from her cell, she is not yet capable of laying fertilised eggs: she is what is called a 'virgin
                            queen.' Several days after hatching from her cell, the queen bee will embark upon he must first 'honeymoon flight' when she will mate with between 10 and 20 drones; she may repeat this procedure several times before she becomes fully fertilized.</li>
                        <li>The queen sets the tone for the hive: if the queen is placid, so is the hive, and likewise if
                            you have a grumpy
                            queen, the workers will be too. </li>
                        <li>Queens normally live for around three years before either dying or being kicked out by the
                            worker bees if she
                        becomes infertile (a so-called 'drone-laying' queen.</li>
                    <li>Queen bees can sting, although they do so rarely. Unlike worker bees, however, they can still
                        multiple times without dying.</li>
                    <li>The brightly coloured spot on the back of many queens is added by the beekeeper to help find her
                        among the thousands
                        of other bees in the hive. The colour of the spot matches the year in which she was born.</li>

            <section>
                <!--The Workers-->
                <div><h3>Workers</h3>
                <p>Worker bees, all of them female, make up the bulk of the colony. During the autumn and winter months,
                    there are only worker bees in the hive aside from the Queen. During the spring and summer, they make
                    up 98 - 99% of all bees in the hive.</p>
                <p>What do worker bees do? The workers go through several different roles depending on their age. The
                    youngest start off as nurse bees, feeding the larvae and ensuring the brood (the eggs and egg cells) remain warm; as they get older, they process the nectar
                    and pollen, produce wax, build honeycomb, feed the queen, and ensure that she is neither too
                    warm nor cold. The oldest workers leave the hive to collect nectar and pollen from plants and flowers.
                </p>
                </div>
                <section>
                <div><ul id="worker-notes"></ul>
                   <li>Worker bees are the most common types of honey bee and they are as essential to the successful running of the give as the queen</li>
                <li>Worker bees take 21 days to grow from from egg to adult</li>
                <li>Worker bees born in spring and summer live for up to 8 weeks; those born in winter can live for 4 - 5 months.</li>
                <li>Worker bees are the stingers! If you have been stung by a honey bee, it is 99.99% sure it was a worker. And it is
                    deadly for the bee: their stingers are barbed. This means that the stinger remains stuck in her victim when a bee
                    pulls herself away, leading to her disembowlment. She will die a short time later.</li>
                <li>Workers will fly up to 8km / 5 miles to gather nectar and pollen.
                <li>Speed: workers can fly at up to 25km/h (18mph) without a load, or around 17km/h (12mph) when carrying pollen,
                    nectar, etc.</li>
                </li>

                <!--The Drones-->
                <section>
                    <div>
                    <h3>Drones</h3>
                    <p>Drones are the male honey bees. The are much larger and bulkier than their worker sisters, have large protruding eyes and live only during
                        the sping and summer months. Their only 'practical' purpose is mating, given that they do not collect pollen or
                        nectar, build honeycomb or have any of the other duties that a worker bee has. However, drones are crucial in
                        that they fertilize the queen bee during her honeymoon flight / flights. An unfertilized queen can only lay
                        drone brood, and as drones have no instinct to gather resources or take care of the brood, a colony full of
                        drones would soon die. So despite their limited role, that role is crucial for the survival of the honey bee.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                <ul id="drone-notes">
                    <li>Drones take 24 days to grow from egg to adult bee.</li>
                    <li>They normally live for 30 - 50 days, though are capable of living for up to 3 months.</li>
                    <li>Drones have no stinger and are completely harmless to humans.</li>
                    <li>As far as scientists can tell, their main purpose is to mate with a queen bee. Those who do successfully mate with a queen die shortly after, as the act of mating is deadly to the drone.</li>
                    <li>Any drones which survive until autumn will be kicked out of the hive by the worker bees to preserve resources for the colony; such drones will then die.</li>
