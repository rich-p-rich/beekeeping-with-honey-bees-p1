            <p>
                Honey bee colonies are mostly female, made up of the queen bee, and
                the worker bees; the only male honey bees are born during the spring
                and summer months, and die off by autumn. Each type of bee has a
                specific set of roles, they look significantly different to the other
                and have differing life-spans.
            </p>
            <section id="the-queen">
                <h3>The queen bee</h3>
                <p>
                    The queen is the dominant female in the hive; she lays eggs throughout
                    the year to ensure the colony has enough bees to survive the fairly
                    short lifespan of the workers and drone. Queens can live up to five
                    years, although a lifespan of 2 - 3 years is more common; some queens
                    become 'drone laying' queens in their later life, which means they are
                    no longer able to lay eggs for worker bees. When the colony senses
                    this, they will either kill her or drive her out of the hive and
                    replace her with a new queen bred from a worker bee egg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it is true to say that the queen is the dominant female in that
                    there is only one, and she is the only egg-layer, it would be
                    incorrect to say that she is in charge. Scientists have yet to
                    definitively define the exact relationship between the queen and the
                    worker bees, but we do know that it is a complex relationship whereby
                    the queen is indeed in charge, but only as long as the worker bees
                    allow her to be. Her importance to the give is however vital, and without a queen, a colony will
                    soon fall apart.
                </p>
                <ul id="queen-notes">
                    <li>There is only one queen bee per hive (with some rare exceptions)</li>
                    <li>The queen take sixteen days to grow from an egg to an adult bee, which is much quicker than
                        workers and drones
                    </li>
                    <li>When she emerges from her cell, she is not yet capable of laying fertilised eggs; she must first
                        embark on her
                        'honeymoon flight' when she will mate with up to around a dozen drones</li>
                    <li>The queen sets the tone for the hive: if the queen is placid, so is the hive, and likewise if
                        you have a grumpy
                        queen, the workers will be too. </li>
                    <li>Queens normally live for around three years before either dying or being kicked out by the
                        worker bees if she
                        becomes infertile (a so-called 'drone-laying' queen.</li>
                    <li>Queen bees can sting, although they do so rarely. Unlike worker bees, however, they can still
                        multiple times without dying.</li>
                    <li>The brightly coloured spot on the back of many queens is added by the beekeeper to help find her
                        among the thousands
                        of other bees in the hive. The colour of the spot matches the year in which she was born.</li>

            <!--The Workers-->
            <section>
                <h3>Worker bees</h3>
                <p>Worker bees, all of them female, make up the bulk of the colony. During the autumn and winter months,
                    there are only worker bees in the hive aside from the Queen. During the spring and summer, they make
                    up 98 - 99% of all bees in the hive.</p>
                <p>What do worker bees do? The workers go through several different roles depending on their age. The
                    youngest start off as nurse bees, feeding the bee larvae; as they get older, they process the nectar
                    and pollen, produce wax, build honeycomb, feed the queen, and ensure that she is neither too
                    warm nor cold. The oldest workers leave the hive to take nectar and pollen from plants and flowers.
                </p>
                <ul id="worker-notes"></ul>
                   <li>Worker bees are the most common types of honey bee and they are as essential to the successful running of the give as the queen</li>
                   <li>Worker bees take 21 days to from from egg to adult</li> 
                   <li>Worker bees born in spring and summer live for up to 8 weeks; those born in winter can live for 4 - 5 months.</li>
                   <li>Worker bees are the stingers! If you have been stung by a honey bee, it is 99.99% sure it was a worker. And it is deadly for the bee: their stingers are barbed. This means that when a bee pulls herself off of her victim, the stinger remains stuck in the target, leading to her disembowlment. She will die a short time later.</li>
