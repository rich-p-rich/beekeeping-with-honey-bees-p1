        <p>
          Honey bee colonies are primarily female: apart from the queen, nearly
          all the other bees are female worker bees. Male honey bees live only
          during the spring and summer months, dying off by autumn. Each type of
          bee has a specific set of roles and looks significantly different.
          Here are the key facts.

        <p>
          The queen is the dominant bee in the hive and the other bees reflect
          her tone: if she is calm, aggressive, busy, or a bit slow, her bees
          will be too. She is the only bee capable of laying eggs to produce
          worker and drone brood and, without a queen, a colony will die.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Queens can live up to five years, although a lifespan of 2 - 3 years
          is more common; some queens become 'drone laying' queens in their
          later life, which means they are no longer able to lay eggs for worker
          bees. When the colony senses this, they will either kill her or drive
          her out of the hive and replace her with a new queen bred from a
          worker bee egg.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Pass Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There is only one queen bee per hive (with some rare exceptions)
          </li>
          <li>
            The queen takes sixteen days to grow from an egg to an adult bee,
            which is much quicker than workers and drones
          </li>
          <li>
            Several days after hatching from her cell, the queen bee will embark
            upon her 'honeymoon flight' when she will mate with between 10 and
            20 drones; she may repeat this procedure several times before she
            becomes fully fertilized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apart from the 'honeymoon flight', the only other reasons a queen
            will leave the hive is to swarm, or if she is rejected by the worker
            bees.
          </li>
          <li>
            The queen sets the tone for the hive: if the queen is placid, so is
            the hive, and likewise if you have a grumpy queen, the workers will
            be too.
          </li>
          <li>
            Queens normally live for around three years before either dying or
            being kicked out by the worker bees if she becomes infertile (a
            so-called 'drone-laying' queen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Queen bees can sting, although they do so rarely. Unlike worker
            bees, however, they can still multiple times without dying.
          </li>
          <li>
            The brightly coloured spot on the back of many queens is added by
            the beekeeper to help find her among the thousands of other bees in
            the hive. The colour of the spot matches the year in which she was
            born.

      <div class="bee-type-text">
        <p>
          While it is true to say that the queen is the dominant bee, the exact
          relationship between the queen and the worker bees is complex. As far
          as we can tell, the queen is indeed in charge, but only as long as the
          worker bees allow her to be. The worker bees influence, for example,
          when and how many eggs a queen should lay, whether she should lay eggs
          at all, and whether the colony should swarm. So influence runs in both
          directions between queens and workers.

          All worker bees are female and they make up the bulk of a colony:
          apart from the Queen, they are the only bees in the hive during autumn
          and winter, while during the spring and summer, they make up 98 - 99%
          of all bees in the colony.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          What do worker bees do? The workers go through several different roles
          depending on their age. The youngest start off as nurse bees, feeding
          the larvae and ensuring the brood (the eggs and egg cells) remain
          warm; as they get older, they process nectar and pollen, produce wax,
          build honeycomb, feed the queen, and ensure that she is neither too
          warm nor cold. The oldest workers leave the hive to collect nectar and
          pollen from plants and flowers.
        </p>

        <ul id="worker-notes">
          <li>
            Worker bees are the most common types of honey bee and they are as
            essential to the successful running of the hive as the queen
          </li>
          <li>Worker bees take 21 days to grow from from egg to adult</li>
          <li>
            Worker bees born in spring and summer live for up to 8 weeks; those
            born in winter can live for 4 - 5 months.
          </li>
          <li>
            Worker bees are the stingers! If you have been stung by a honey bee,
            it is 99.99% likely it was a worker. And it is deadly for the bee.
            When a bee pulls herself away from her victim, the barbed end of her
            stingers results in her disembowling herself. She will die a short
            time later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Workers will fly up to 8km / 5 miles to gather nectar and pollen.

            Speed: workers can fly at up to 25km/h (18mph) without a load, or
            around 17km/h (12mph) when carrying pollen, nectar, etc.

          Drones are the male honey bees. The are much larger and bulkier than
          their worker sisters, and live only during the sping and summer months
          for, at most, 90 days. Their only 'practical' purpose is mating, given
          that they do not collect pollen or nectar, build no honeycomb and none
          of the other tasks that a worker bee has.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, drones are crucial in that they fertilize the queen bee
          during her honeymoon flight / flights. An unfertilized queen can only
          lay drone brood, and as drones have no instinct to gather resources or
          take care of the brood, a colony full of drones would soon die. So
          despite their limited role, they are crucial for the survival of the
          honey bee.

        <ul id="drone-notes">
          <li>Drones take 24 days to grow from egg to adult bee.</li>
          <li>
            They normally live for 30 - 50 days, though are capable of living
            for up to 3 months.

          <li>Drones have no stinger and are completely harmless to humans.</li>
          <li>
            As far as scientists can tell, their main purpose is to mate with a
            queen bee. Those who do successfully mate with a queen die shortly
            after, as the act of mating is deadly to the drone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any drones which survive until autumn will be kicked out of the hive
            by the worker bees to preserve resources for the queen and the
            workers; these drones will then die.
