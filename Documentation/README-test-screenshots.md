# Beekeeping with the Honey Bee

This website is designed to offer a window into the world of beekeeping
with the honey bee. I have been beekeeping for just over five years and I well remember many of the basic questions I had before I started the hobbey, such as what is the difference between honey bees and bumblebees, what is in a beehive, and how do you actually get the honey?! With this website, I hope to answer the most basic questions to help people who are completely new to the hobby find their feet. This is also why I have included 'honey bee' in the title of the website: I don't think it is clear to everyone that honey bees are the specific type of bee kept by beekeepers.

I hope to answer such questions in a clear and interesting manner and so my target audience is people with a general / casual interest in bees and beekeeping, and nature in general. Hopefully the site will entertain the more experienced beekeeper along the way, but they are not my target audience at this point; that would be my next step - exploring and presenting more specialised beekeeping topics that would attract practising beekeepers as well.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**

  - The navbar can be found on all four pages. It is designed to be fully responsive across mibil (small and large), tablets and laptops / desktops.
  - It has a clicklable logo, and links to the home, bee and contact pages.
  - The navbar is accessible via a three bar 'burger' for screens up to 767 pixels while the individual items present themselves as plain links in screens 768 pixels and over.
  - The navbar is designed to help users easily navigate from page to page across all devices.
  - The fourth 'thank you' page is deliberately not listed in the navbar as this page should only be accessed by people filling out the form on the contact page.

- **The landing page image**

  - Visitors to the wqebsite find an image of a honey bee approaching a flower with a short accompanying text to illustrate what the site is about.

- **The Footer**

  - The footer section includes links to an instagram page which they could follow and contribute their own material.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media

- **The Bee Page**

  - The Bee page introduces the visitor to the three types of honey bee: queen, drone and worker. These are shown in a single image at the top of the page so they understand the basic phyiscal differences in appearance before they read about each bee in detail.
  - This section is valuable to the user as it breaks down the different physical characteristics, roles and behaviour of each type of bee.

- Each bee is then introduce with a separate image and accompanying text to explain in detail what they are, what they do and how they contribute to the overall success of the hive:
  ![Queen]
  ![Worker]
  ![Drone]
- This is valuable to the user as the role and lives of each type of bee is very different and needs to be clarified in detail; when I started beekeeping, I was unaware of these differences and, from speaking to friends about my hobby, it is clear that this is quite normal.

- **Contact Page**

  - This page is intended as a portal for those who have any questions about the hobbey; in the long-run, it would also be a place to sign up for a newsletter that offers monthly and seasonal hints and tips for beekeepers of all levels of experience.
  - The image is intended to make the page more attractive.

### Features Left to Implement

- I would like to complete pages on the following:
- Beekeeping equipment and schedule: this would go from the basic beekeeping equipment you need to get started to more specialist equipment for harvesting honey and treating varroa mites.
- A gallery of images about bees and beekeeping.
- Swarm page: information on why bees swarm, how to prevent (discourage) it as a beekeeper, what to do if you find one and videos of swarms in action
- Honey: information on how to harvest honey, when to harvest and how much to leave
- Winter: many people ask me what bees do over winter, when it snows, etc, so I would address these questions on a separate page.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

I deployed the site to GitHub pages for the first time on 13.12.2023. I followed the steps outlined in the guidance:

- From the GitHub repository -> Settings tab
- Select pages
- Set source to 'Deploy from Branch'
- Select main folder
- Folder set to / (root)

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
