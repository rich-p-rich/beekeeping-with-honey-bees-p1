            <h3>The Honey Bee</h3>
            <p>
                There are over 20,000 known species of bee in the world, from
                bumblebees to leafcutter bees to mason bees. But beekeeping involves
                keeping hives full of the Honey Bee, also known in scientific
                language by its Latin name of Apis Mellifera.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Honey Bees live in colonies of 20,000 to 80,000 depending on the
                time of the year and strength of the colony. And making honey is what they do. Over the centuries,
                beekeepers have worked out ways to replicate their natural habitat with man-made beehives with
                wood, polyester and even concrete. Given the size of the honey bee colony, their natural disposition for
                making honey and our ability to set up hives with which we can interact, beekeeping involves keeping
                honey bees rather than bumblebees or any other type.
